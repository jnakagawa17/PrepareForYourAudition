“Prepare for your Audition” takes place in a building molded after Montague. You play a person who had forgotten that they had an audition today and so is scrambling to prepare. My game is based off of a point based system where if you obtain a certain number of points you get a the ending corresponding to that score. One of the puzzles you encounter is related to finding sheet music. In order to open the room in which sheet music is contained you must feed a desk attendant. You can do this buy buying food from vending machine. If you give her some piece of food she will give you the key to the Music Library. However, you can buy another piece of food which if you eat will improve your score. This is similar to how you can take sheet music and depending on the difficulty of the piece you will gain some number of points. You will originally get more points for easier pieces. However if you talk to a man and have him help you practice the harder pieces will give you more points. I have five rooms west hallway, east hallway, practice room, music library, and audition room. There are three food products you can buy oreos, peanuts, and apples. One thing I learned how to do is use If otherwise statements to make certain things occur if certain cases are met. I found the Inform 7 handbook to be the most helpful source for learning how to program in Inform 7. This is due to the great number of topics that it covers as well as the example code it uses.
