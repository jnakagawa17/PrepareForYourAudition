Today is the day! More than a decade of work has led you to this one moment. You nervously walk down a paved stone hallway towards your test. You are incredibly unprepared for this Piano Audition. You haven&apos;t practiced or even really decided on what piece you are going to play. In truth you grew so nervous every time you thought of the audition that in the last few weeks leading up to now you had trained yourself not to think of it at all. You woke up today at 9:00 glad that it&apos;s finally the weekend and you can for go responsibilities for the next couple days only to find to your shock and dismay that on you calendar was written Piano Audition: 10:00 A.M. You didn&apos;t have time to grab sheet music or anything else. You pass through from the west side of the hallway to the east stopping before the attendant&apos;s desk.

    *** As you play through your piece you begin to glare. Every thing sounds slightly off. A few sections sound pretty terrible but some places sound nice. Every note is just off timed, all the dynamics are relatively closely adhered to. You glance over at Susan Wong and find her cleanning her finger nails. When you finish she says, &quot;I won&apos;t lie that didn&apos;t sound like someone who was prepared. It could have been a lot worse but it could also have been a lot better.&quot; You have failed your audition ***


In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 10, in 32 turns.

It rambles on for awhile about the construction of the Music Building then discusses various musical techniques stating that &quot;A common mistake of amateur pianists is the over dramatization of entire pieces. Many are so caught up in the pulse of the song that they fail to realize that certain sections are meant to be nondescript to act as a cleansing of the palate before the next dramatic section.&quot;

    *** As you play through your piece you begin to frown. Every thing sounds okay. Nothing is particularly terrible but it isn&apos;t inspiring. Every note is just off timed, all the dynamics are relatively closely adhered to. You glance over at Susan Wong and find her slightly board gazing out a window. When you finish she says, &quot;Not bad. Pay attention to some of the dynamics. Over all you did pretty well.&quot; Congratulations you passed your audition. ***


In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 11, in 21 turns.

You haven&apos;t practiced or even really decided on what piece you are going to play. In truth you grew so nevious everytime you thought of the audition that in the last few weeks leading up to now you had trained yourself not to think of it at all. You woke up today at 9:00 glad that it&apos;s finally the weekend and you can for go responsibilites for the next couple days only to find to your shock and dismay that on you calendar was writen Piano Audition: 10:00 A.M. You didn&apos;t have time to grab sheet music or anything else. You pass through from the west side of the hallway to the east stopping before the attendant&apos;s desk.

    *** As you play through your piece you begin to frown. Every thing sounds okay. Nothing is particularly terrible but it isn&apos;t inspiring. Every note is just off timed, all the dynamics are relatively closely adhered to. You glance over at Susan Wong and find her slightly board gazing out a window. When you finish she says, &quot;Not bad. Pay attention to some of the dynamics. Over all you did pretty well.&quot; Congratulations you passed your audition. ***


In that game you scored 6 out of a possible 10, in 45 turns.

    *** As you play through your piece you begin to glare. Every thing sounds slightly off. A few sections sound pretty terrible but some places sound nice. Every note is just off timed, all the dynamics are relatively closely adhered to. You glance over at Susan Wong and find her cleanning her finger nails. When you finish she says, &quot;I won&apos;t lie that didn&apos;t sound like someone who was prepared. It could have been a lot worse but it could also have been a lot better.&quot; You have failed your audition ***


In that game you scored 3 out of a possible 11, in 40 turns.


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?
